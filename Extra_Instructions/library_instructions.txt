
Till now, you have been including all the .MODEL declaration
in the netlist itself. This tends to make your code lengthy
and difficult to read. A good coding pracice is to write all
the model declarations in a separate library file and 'include'
it in your netlist. This is similar to the #include statement in
C but the syntax is a bit different.

STEPS:
1) Copy all the .model declaration into a separate text file.
2) Save this text file with a .lib extension in any folder whose
   path is easy to  write. For example, D:\myLib.lib
3) Go to your netlist, remove all the .model declaration and replace it
   with this:
	.lib D:\myLib.lib
4) Save and run your netlist.

Note: It will be compulsory to do so in exam, so it is advised that you 
      practice it with one of the netlists you have already written. We 
      are providing a modified version of example_6.cir taught to you
      in the first session. Have a look at it.
