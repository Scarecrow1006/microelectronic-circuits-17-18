3. [SPICE Commands](http://www.ecircuitcenter.com/SPICEsummary.htm)

##### Expectations from Students:
1. As a part of this course, students are expected to conduct all simulation by writing the SPICE Netlists themselves without the use of Schematic.
2. Students are expected to be crystal-clear with their concepts in Micro-electronic Circuits. Any doubts with the same should be clarified with the course instructor or any of the teaching assistants. It is also suggested that this exercise should be performed **much** before the test and not at the last minute.
3. Using LT Spice is a lot about practice. Do not expect to magically understand the use of the software just on the basis of the demo sessions. A hands-on experience of the software is irrefutable in order to understand it's usage.


It is also suggested that you keep checking this repository for problems, resources, etc. Notices for the same shall be put on Nalanda.
